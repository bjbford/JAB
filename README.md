## CprE 186 Project (Introduction to Computer Engineering and Problem Solving II)

# WowWee Robosapien Remote Android App
### Team JAB: (Jared Andrew Brian)

This was a semester long open-ended project class, meeting once a week for an hour. We chose to create an Android application using an old infrared controlled robot, to improve our Java programming skills. Jared and Andrew's primary tasks was the UI, and Brian's responsibility was reverse-engineering the infrared communication for the robot.
